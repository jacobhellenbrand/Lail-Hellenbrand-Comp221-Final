Implementing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

# This is our code for implenting the FFT!
The implementation itself is meant for a very simple usage of the FFT. Anticipated inputs are just arrays of points that should be length that is equal to a power of 2. 
 Running the code is super simple: 
  * Open the repository, let everything load, and hit run.
  * In the console you should see a series of test cases running. 
    * These return True or False depending on if our code gives the anticipated output. 
    * Look closely at outputs, our code has some issues evaluating floating point numbers. As a result some rounding issues may result that could cause a test to return "False" even though a correct output is returned. 
* If you would like to create your own test cases we used this website to determine what outputs should be for a series of points.
